# Pentapolar Algorithm Implementation

This document details the algorithmic implementation of the pentapolar system, focusing on state advancement, information transformation, and computational mechanisms.

## Environment State Management

The Environment class manages state progression through three primary methods:

```typescript
// Return the current state of the environment
observe(): LocaleEnvironment;

// Advance the environment's state by one timestep
step(): void;

// Reset the environment's state to its initial configuration
reset(): void;
```

### Observation Mechanism

The `observe` method returns the current state as a LocaleEnvironment object containing:

- Spatial properties (positions, velocities, rotations)
- Mass and time information
- Relationship data between objects
- Visibility information

Key principle: **Object positions in an environment are only updated when the environment is being observed.** Otherwise, the system uses quantum state calculations to optimize performance.

### State Advancement Algorithm

The `step` method advances the environment state through the following steps:

1. Calculate quantum state for all objects based on their last known positions
2. Use the quantum state to determine new positions for all objects
3. Update the direction of motion based on the quantum state
4. Process any pending events in the event queue
5. Notify observers of state changes

## Information Transformation Processes

The pentapolar system implements five core transformation processes that form the complete information cycle:

### 1. Absorption Process

```typescript
// Environment absorption implementation
absorb(): void {
    // Four key absorption transformations
    this.absorbLocalParticlesToGlobalEnergy();
    this.emitLocalParticlesToGlobalEnergy();
    this.absorbGlobalEnergyToLocalParticles();
    this.emitGlobalEnergyToLocalParticles();
}
```

The absorption process handles the following transformations:

- **Environment (nonlocal)** absorbs local particles from parent environment → converts to global energy for child environment
- **Environment (nonlocal)** emits local particles to child environment → converts to global energy for parent environment
- **Environment (local)** absorbs global energy from parent environment → converts to local particles for child environment
- **Environment (local)** emits global energy to child environment → converts to local particles for parent environment

### 2. Listening/Vibration Process

```typescript
listen(): void {
    // Four key listening transformations
    this.vibrateLocalParticlesToGlobalEnergy();
    this.vibrateLocalParticlesToGlobalEnergy();
    this.vibrateGlobalEnergyToLocalParticles();
    this.vibrateGlobalEnergyToLocalParticles();
}
```

The listening process handles similar transformations but with vibration mechanics that process and transform the absorbed information.

### 3. Execution Process

```typescript
execute(): void {
    // Four key execution transformations
    this.executeLocalParticlesToGlobalEnergy();
    this.executeLocalParticlesToGlobalEnergy();
    this.executeGlobalEnergyToLocalParticles();
    this.executeGlobalEnergyToLocalParticles();
}
```

The execution process applies decision-making algorithms to the processed information, determining the appropriate actions.

### 4. Mediation Process

```typescript
mediate(): void {
    // Four key mediation transformations
    this.mediateLocalParticlesToGlobalEnergy();
    this.mediateLocalParticlesToGlobalEnergy();
    this.mediateGlobalEnergyToLocalParticles();
    this.mediateGlobalEnergyToLocalParticles();
}
```

The mediation process coordinates between different components, ensuring coherent transformation from processing to output.

### 5. Emission Process

```typescript
emit(): void {
    // Four key emission transformations
    this.emitLocalParticlesToGlobalEnergy();
    this.emitLocalParticlesToGlobalEnergy();
    this.emitGlobalEnergyToLocalParticles();
    this.emitGlobalEnergyToLocalParticles();
}
```

The emission process outputs the processed information back to the environment.

## Information Flow Sequence

The complete information flow sequence follows the pattern:

```
EMISSION IS ABSORBED BY ABSORBER
→ THEN RELEASED AS ABSORPTION AS VIBRATION
→ THEN VIBRATED BY VIBRATOR AS VIBRATION
→ THEN EXECUTED BY EXECUTOR AS EXECUTION
→ THEN MEDIATED BY MEDIATOR AS MEDIATION
→ THEN EMITTED BY EMITTER AS EMISSION
```

## Physics Implementation

The LocaleInformation class implements physical interactions between objects in the environment:

```typescript
// Calculate force between two LocaleInformation entities
forceBetween(other: LocaleInformation): Vector3 {
    const distance = this.position.distanceTo(other.position);
    const direction = other.position.subtract(this.position).normalize();
    const magnitude = (this.mass * other.mass) / (distance * distance);
    return direction.multiplyScalar(magnitude);
}

// Update position based on physics calculations
update(): void {
    // Apply forces from all visible objects
    const forces = this.visibleObjects().map(obj => this.forceBetween(obj));
    const netForce = forces.reduce((acc, force) => acc.add(force), new Vector3(0, 0, 0));
    
    // Update velocity based on net force
    const acceleration = netForce.divideScalar(this.mass);
    this.velocity = this.velocity.add(acceleration);
    
    // Update position based on velocity
    this.position = this.position.add(this.velocity);
    
    // Update time
    this.time += 1;
}
```

## Polarity and Dipoles

Important principles in the algorithmic implementation:

- **Local-Local Dipoles**: Do not exist in the implementation
- **Dipoles**: All dipoles are monopoles that connect to the global dipole
- **Polarity Calculation**: Polarity is the absolute value of the global dipole

```typescript
// Calculate polarity between information entities
polarityBetween(other: Information): Polarity {
    // Create new polarity object
    const result = new Polarity();
    
    // Calculate absolute difference between polarity values
    result.absorb = Math.abs(this.polarity.absorb - other.polarity.absorb);
    result.listen = Math.abs(this.polarity.listen - other.polarity.listen);
    result.execute = Math.abs(this.polarity.execute - other.polarity.execute);
    result.mediate = Math.abs(this.polarity.mediate - other.polarity.mediate);
    result.emit = Math.abs(this.polarity.emit - other.polarity.emit);
    
    return result;
}
```

## Event System Implementation

The event system enables communication between components:

```typescript
// Register an event handler
on(event: string, eventHandler: Handler): void {
    if (!this.handlers[event]) {
        this.handlers[event] = [];
    }
    this.handlers[event].push(eventHandler);
}

// Emit an event
emit(event: string, info: LocaleInformation): void {
    if (this.handlers[event]) {
        for (const handler of this.handlers[event]) {
            handler.handle(event, info);
        }
    }
}
```

## Optimization Techniques

The pentapolar system employs several optimization techniques:

1. **Quantum State Calculation**: Instead of updating all object positions continuously, the system calculates a quantum state for the entire environment
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Object positions are only updated when observed
3. **Event Queueing**: Events are queued and processed in batches during state advancement
4. **Force Caching**: Forces between objects can be cached and reused when relative positions haven't changed
5. **Visibility Culling**: Only objects within visible range are considered for interactions

These algorithmic implementations form the foundation of the pentapolar system, enabling efficient simulation of complex information flow and processing while maintaining the conceptual framework of the five poles.
