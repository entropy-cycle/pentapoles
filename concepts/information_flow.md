# Information Flow in Pentapolar Systems

## Basic Flow Sequence

In a pentapolar system, information flows through a defined sequence of five poles:

```
Absorber → Listener → Executor → Mediator → Radiator
```

Each transition represents a specific processing phase:

```
Absorber → Absorption → Listener → Listening → Executor → Execution → Mediator → Mediation → Radiator → Radiation
```

## Information Transformation Process

### 1. Absorption Phase

The absorber pole collects information from the environment and begins the processing cycle. During absorption:

- External signals are captured and converted to internal representations
- Raw data is collected for further processing
- The system boundary is crossed as external information becomes internal

### 2. Listening Phase

The listener pole receives information from the absorber and processes it. During listening:

- Raw data is structured and interpreted
- Patterns are recognized and categorized
- Information is prepared for decision-making

### 3. Execution Phase

The executor pole evaluates the processed information and determines appropriate actions. During execution:

- Decision algorithms are applied to processed data
- Conditional logic determines the execution path
- Action plans are formulated based on the evaluated information

### 4. Mediation Phase

The mediator pole coordinates between the decision process and the output mechanism. During mediation:

- Results from execution are formatted for output
- Resource allocation for response is determined
- Consistency and coherence of the response is ensured

### 5. Radiation Phase

The radiator pole emits the processed information back to the environment. During radiation:

- Internal representations are converted to external signals
- The response is transmitted to the environment
- The system boundary is crossed as internal information becomes external

## Local and Global Information Exchange

Information flow in pentapolar systems can be categorized as either local or global:

### Local to Global Transformations

- **Local Absorber to Global Actor**: Information from a localized source is absorbed and made available to the broader system
- **Local Radiator to Global Actor**: Locally processed information is radiated to influence the global environment

### Global to Local Transformations

- **Global Absorber to Local Actor**: Information from the broader system is absorbed and focused on a specific component
- **Global Radiator to Local Actor**: Globally processed information is radiated to influence a specific target

## Cyclical Information Flow

Information in pentapolar systems can flow in complete cycles, forming dipole structures:

```
Local Absorber → Global Actor → Local Radiator
Local Radiator → Global Actor → Local Absorber
Global Absorber → Local Actor → Global Radiator
Global Radiator → Local Actor → Global Absorber
```

These cycles facilitate continuous information processing and feedback mechanisms within the system.

## Emergent Properties

An important characteristic of pentapolar systems is that information values in one environment are often opaque to other environments, with only emergent properties being visible. This encapsulation allows for:

1. Isolation of implementation details between components
2. Abstraction of complex subsystems into manageable interfaces
3. Creation of complex environments composed of simpler environments
4. Hierarchical information processing with different levels of abstraction

This principle enables pentapolar systems to model complex, nested information processing architectures with clear boundaries and interfaces between components.
